 Hi There , This is React based Web-App.
 # Technoligies_Used
 1. React js
 2. Hooks Used are :- State , Ref , Reducer , React-Context-Api(to mainatin the list of data available accross all components in the app.
 3. Javascript 
 4. HTML
 5. CSS Modules
 6. Firebase Auth API
 # FLOWS
 1. On Refresh Everything goes to initial state (But the user still remains Logged in)
 2. You cannot navigate back by backPressing becuase its a SPA(Single Page Application without any Routing).
                                                              Thanks!!
