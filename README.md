 Hi There , This is React based Web-App.
 # Technoligies_Used
 1. React js
 2. Hooks Used are :- State , Ref , Reducer , React-Context-Api(to mainatin the list of data available accross all components in the app.
 3. Javascript 
 4. HTML
 5. CSS Modules
 6. Firebase Auth API
 7. Browser's local storage for maintaining Uers's LogIn and LogOut State.
 # FLAWS
 1. On Refresh Everything goes to initial state (But the user still remains Logged in)
 2. You cannot navigate back by backPressing becuase its a SPA(Single Page Application without any Routing).
