 Hi There , This is a React based Web-App.
 # Technologies_Used
 1. React js
 2. Hooks Used are :- State , Ref , Reducer , React-Context-Api(to maintain the list of data available across all components in the app.
 3. Javascript 
 4. HTML
 5. CSS Modules
 6. Firebase Auth API
 7. Browser's local storage for maintaining Uers's LogIn and LogOut State.
 # FLAWS
 1. On Refresh Everything goes to initial state (But the user still remains Logged in)
 2. You cannot navigate back by backPressing because its an SPA(Single Page Application without any Routing).
                                                              Thanks!!
